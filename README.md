# Add Campaign Reaction Analysis

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains code and documentation for analyzing the reactions of two different groups to two separate advertising campaigns. The primary goal is to understand the time it takes for each group to react to the campaigns. We use statistical techniques to compare the distributions of reaction times and evaluate the significance of any differences observed.

## Content

This Jupyter Notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Generation**: Explanation of the process of generating synthetic data representing the reaction times of two groups to the advertising campaigns.

2. **Campaign Analysis**: Statistical analysis of the reaction times of the two groups using the t-test and visualization techniques.

## Data Generation

The data generation process involves creating synthetic data for the reaction times of two groups. Two normal distributions are generated to simulate the reaction times of each group. The data represent the time (in seconds) taken by each group to respond to the respective advertising campaigns.

## Campaign Analysis

The campaign analysis section performs the following tasks:

- **t-Test**: A two-sample t-test is conducted to compare the means of the reaction times between the two groups. This test helps determine whether the observed differences in reaction times are statistically significant.

- **Visualization**: Visualizations, such as histograms, are used to illustrate the distribution of reaction times for each group and provide insight into potential differences.

## Interpretation

The analysis performed in this notebook aims to answer questions related to the effectiveness and impact of the advertising campaigns on the two groups. By comparing reaction times and utilizing statistical tests, we can understand whether any observed differences are statistically significant or likely due to random chance.

## Usage

To run the code in this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`add_campaign_analysis.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially.

Please note that the data used in this notebook is synthetic and is meant for illustrative purposes. You can replace it with real data if available.
